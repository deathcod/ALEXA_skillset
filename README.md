# ALEXA_skillset  

This is my self project to understand how ALEXA works and how AWS works. So here I am tried to build a basic assistant who notifies you with all the coding and hackathons going online. The current version only supports codechef, codeforces, Venturesity.

My aim in this project is to build a product that can be tested locally without using AWS and then deploy in AWS. I am trying to achieve some of the checkpoints that I set for myself. Like having a quality code and scalability. Also noting down all the problems I faced in the journey.

# TODO LIST

* Test environment is not setup
* Code coverage is not being done
* Refactor the code.
* Add more sites to scrap. 
* Add more functionality to the assistance
	- set notification 
	- store all the messages being done with each users. 
	- store the userid or authentication token from each user so that it helps to recognize already visited users.

* Future thought, make the assistant smart enough to segregate the competitions and retrieve the one that the user is more intrested in. It is classifing each of the competitions based upon the user's history . For the fresh user it will be based on the content which other users are mostly interested.
