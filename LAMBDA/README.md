# PROBLEM FACED

** 1) So this was the first problem I faced, what should be the code structure such that I can differentiate the code in the lambda from the query. such that all the query be in the database section. Basically maintaining the integrity of the space, and place the code that should be. **  

* I am thinking of JSON. Let me thinking of more clean solution if possible  
* After careful thinking and referencing from my previous work I conclude that I will write the query in the preocess query and forward it to the the database for running the the query. So I will write the filterexpresion in the process query itself.
